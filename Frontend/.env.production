# Production Environment Configuration for ANNE Web Application Frontend
# This file is used when deploying to Vercel or other production environments

# Backend API URL - UPDATE THIS AFTER DEPLOYING BACKEND
# Current: Points to frontend (WRONG!) - Need to deploy backend first


# INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Deploy your backend to Vercel first
# 2. Get the backend URL (e.g., https://anne-backend-xyz.vercel.app)
# 3. Replace REACT_APP_API_URL with the backend URL
# 4. Remove trailing slash from URL
# 5. Push changes and redeploy frontend
